Using the provided code snippet, simulate rolling a six-sided die 10 times.
Extend the simulation to keep track of how many times each number is rolled.
After the simulation, print out the frequency of each number.

import random

# Initialize a dictionary to keep track of dice roll frequencies
roll_count = {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0}

# Let's roll the dice 10 times
for _ in range(10):
    dice_roll = random.randint(1, 6)
    # Update the roll_count dictionary
    roll_count[dice_roll] += 1
    print("You rolled a " + str(dice_roll) + "!")

# Print out the frequency of each number
for number, frequency in roll_count.items():
    print(f"Number {number} was rolled {frequency} times.")

# This is the same code that was provided on the assignment page - nothing was added but it runs
# as expected. If I'm meant to change the code somehow, that wasn't clear in the directions.
