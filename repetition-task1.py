Using the provided genres list, write a for loop that prints out each
genre with a custom message. Extend this task by adding a counter that
displays the number of the track before the genre.

# Our playlist of genres
genres = ['Jazz', 'Rock', 'Hip-hop', 'Classical']

# Initialize track number
track_number = 1

# Spinning through the genres
for genre in genres:
    print(f"Track {track_number}: Now playing {genre}")
    track_number += 1
